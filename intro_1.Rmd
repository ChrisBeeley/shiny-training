## Sessions

* Three sessions of two hours
* Multi speed to cater for different skill levels
* Feel free to do some or all of the syllabus in each session
* I'll try to stay on after each session if you need any more help

## Session one

* What is Shiny?
* What does it do?
* Intro to reactivity
* *Application 1- minimal*
* Your first application
* *Application 2- Sitrep*
* Build a real application
* Reactive expressions
* Optional
    * NSE in Shiny applications
    * Bookmarks

## What is Shiny?

* Shiny is a web application programming framework
* It's a big sack of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, all called from R, basically
* It requires no knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, or CSS, but if you have that knowledge it will do more

## What does Shiny do?

* It does this

```{r, echo = FALSE}

shinyAppDir(paste0(system.file(package = "shiny"), "/examples/01_hello/"))

```

## But it also does this

```{r, out.width = "1000px", echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("figures/monte_carlo.png")

```

## And this

```{r, out.width = "900px", echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("figures/geoexplorer.png")

```

## How does Shiny work?

* Reactive programming
* When the inputs change, the outputs change
* Outputs *take a dependency on* inputs
* The Bad Old Days
* What you lose
* E.g. CRUD is hard
* You can control reactive dependencies

## One file, two file Shiny applications

* Back in the day Shiny apps were two files
* I'm going to teach you single file
* I don't love single file but that's the way the wind is blowing
* Either server.R and ui.R (defining server and UI)
* Or app.R with separate bits for server and UI
* UI- user interfacce
* Server- the guts. Graphs, data munging, etc.

## The fundamentals

* The fundamentals of Shiny apps are very simple
* You define a bunch of inputs using functions like textInput() and numericInput() in the UI
* Each input has a name
* You lay out your outputs in the UI using functions like textOutput() and plotOutput()
* Each output has a name
* Using the names you just defined in the UI, you define a bunch of outputs in the server using functions like renderPlot() and renderText()
* Within the server you can access the value of inputs using input$nameOfInput
* It makes a lot of sense if you just browse the code, which we will do now

## Let's make an app!

* File... 
* New... 
* Shiny web app... 
* Application name... 
* Single... 
* Choose directory

## We'll add a title to get warmed up

* Inputs are defined like this 

```{r, eval=FALSE}

textInput("nameOfInput", "Label for input")

```

* See ?textInput for more
* Add textInput(...) to the UI definition. In sidebarPanel()
* Inputs are referred to like this 

```{r, eval=FALSE}

input$nameOfInput

```

* And then add main = input$nameOfInput to the hist(...)

## The answer

UI

```{r, eval = FALSE}

sidebarPanel(
  sliderInput("bins",
              "Number of bins:",
              min = 1,
              max = 50,
              value = 30),
  textInput("titleInput", "Add a title")
),

```

Server

```{r, eval = FALSE}

hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', 
     border = 'white', main = input$titleInput)

```

## Now let's make an application from scratch!

* Demo **sitrep_first**

## Some code for you to use

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# at the top of the code file

library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(DT)

load(url("https://github.com/nhs-r-community/shiny-training/blob/main/ShinyContactData.rda?raw=true"))

# UI

selectInput()
DTOutput()
plotOutput()

# server side

output$table <- renderDT({
  
  ShinyContactData %>% 
    filter(Year %in% input$year,
           Status %in% input$status) %>%
    group_by(Month, Group1) %>% 
    summarise(count = n()) %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 
    spread(., Group1, count)
})

```

## The exercise

* Find this code in sitrep_first.R
* A lot of this workshop will be you writing your own code
* In each case you will have
    * A code file with some hints in, like sitrep_first.R
    * The answer (in this case in sitrep_first)
* If you get stuck ask for help
* Or look at the answer, but try to do this sparingly
* Feel free to search the help (like ?renderDT)
* Feel free to use Google
* Feel free to ask for help
* Today is designed to be like your actual coding (except in this case you have the answers ðŸ˜‰)

## Reactive expressions

- Reactive expressions are expressions that change when their inputs change
- They enable you to maintain the data fetch/ clean code for several outputs in one place
- Crucially, they *cache* their results, which means that it's run once, for all the outputs, and only changes if its inputs change
- Great for computationally intensive or bandwidth heavy data functions

## Standard Shiny

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

node_df <- create_node_df(n = 5 ,
                          label = c("Input 1", "Input 2", "Output 1", 
                                    "Output 2", "Output 3"),
                          fontsize = 24,
                          fillcolor = c("green", "green", "red", "red", "red"),
                          fontcolor = "black")

edge_df <- data.frame("from" = c(1, 1, 2, 2),
                      "to" = c(3, 4, 4, 5))

i_graph_1 <-
  create_graph()

i_graph_2 <-
  i_graph_1 %>%
  add_nodes_from_table(
    table = node_df,
    label_col = label)

i_graph_3 <-
  i_graph_2 %>%
  add_edges_from_table(
    table = edge_df,
    from_col = from,
    to_col = to,
    from_to_map = id_external)

i_graph_3 %>% render_graph()

```

## With reactive object

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

node_dfR <- create_node_df(n = 6,
                           label = c("Input 1", "Input 2", "Reactive object", "Output 1", 
                                     "Output 2", "Output 3"),
                           fontsize = 24,
                           fillcolor = c("green", "green", "blue", "red", "red", "red"),
                           fontcolor = "black")

edge_dfR <- data.frame("from" = c(1, 2, 3, 3, 3),
                       "to" = c(3, 3, 4, 5, 6))

i_graph_1 <-
  create_graph()

i_graph_2 <-
  i_graph_1 %>%
  add_nodes_from_table(
    table = node_dfR,
    label_col = label)

i_graph_3 <-
  i_graph_2 %>%
  add_edges_from_table(
    table = edge_dfR,
    from_col = from,
    to_col = to,
    from_to_map = id_external)

i_graph_3 %>% render_graph()

```

## Let's add reactivity

* Demo **sitrep_second**
* Clean up the data with reactive expressions
* Find this code in sitrep_second.R

## The code

```{r, eval = FALSE}

returnData <- reactive({
  
  return_data %>% 
    
    ## complete  
})

output$table <- renderDT({
  
  returnData() %>% 
    #...
})

output$graph <- renderPlot({
  
  returnData() %>% 
    #...
})

```

## The answer

```{r, eval = FALSE}

output$table <- renderDT({
  
  returnData() %>% 
    spread(., Group1, count)
})

output$graph <- renderPlot({
  
  returnData() %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = Month, y = count, colour = Group1)) +
    geom_line()
})

```

* Find this code in sitrep_second.R

## Debugging

* Start simple
* Make sure your code works outside of Shiny!
* Use of cat()
* Breakpoints and browser()
* Run options(shiny.reactlog=TRUE)
* Run
* Press Ctrl+F3 for an interactive summary of reactive activity in your application
* This has saved me more than once

## Any more for any more

* Experience tells me that some of you will only get this far
* Extra material for those who are ahead (which there are sometimes)
* Passing variable names in Shiny applications
* Bookmarking

## Passing variable names

```{r, error = TRUE}

max_by <- function(data, by) {
  data %>%
    group_by(by) %>%
    summarise(maximum = max(height, na.rm = TRUE))
}

starwars %>% 
  max_by(by)

```

## Passing variable names

```{r}

max_by <- function(data, by) {
  data %>%
    group_by({{ by }}) %>%
    summarise(maximum = max(height, na.rm = TRUE))
}

starwars %>% 
  max_by(gender)

```

## Application to Shiny

* In Shiny we are passing strings, not bare variable names:

```{r}

max_by <- function(data, var, by) {
  data %>%
    group_by(.data[[by]]) %>%
    summarise(maximum = max(height, na.rm = TRUE))
}
  
starwars %>% max_by(by = "gender")

```

* That's it! You understand how to pass strings
* E.g. from selectInput()

## Last application

* Give the option to group by week/ month
* Give the option to group by group 1/ group 2
* And add bookmarking the state of the app
    * I'll leave that to your Google skills
    * Function: enableBookmarking()
